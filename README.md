Roguelike
=========

A game I tried to write in Java. Most notable feature is the algorithm that generates an overworld map with randomly-named locales, and interface code written on top of the Swing library.

Version history:

v_0.02: Dragging windows works well. Started using GitHub.

v_0.01: Algorithm generates town/dungeon nodes, creates names. Interface sort of works.
